forbidSleepingMode will forbid your computer to enter into sleep mode, acting as if there was activity all the time.
Technically, it sends a "tickle" to the computer every x minutes forcing the display to remain on (hence: don't set your screensaver to come before x minutes).

Usage
*****
Just click on the "forbidSleepingMode.exe", set the tickling interval and click on the Start button. Keep the application open.
