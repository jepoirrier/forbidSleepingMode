forbidSleepingMode will forbid your computer to enter into sleep mode, acting as if there was activity all the time.
Technically, it sends a "tickle" to the computer every 10 minutes forcing the display to remain on (hence: don't set your screensaver to come before 10 minutes).

Usage
*****
Just click on the "forbidSleepingMode.exe" and keep it open.


Restriction
***********

- Only works on Windows with .Net framework 4 (normally already installed on all updated computers)
- Only tested on Windows XP (but should work on any later Windows version)
